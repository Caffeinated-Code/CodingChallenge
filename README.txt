Stochastic epidemics on networks. Actual epidemics involve discrete events of infection and recovery. In this exercise we will simulate these discrete events and compare the results with the theoretical results summarized on Box 10.7 which are obtained using a continuous approximation.
(a) Generate a random network (ER) with average degree k ̄ = 5 and at least N = 1000 nodes. Limit the network to its largest connected component.
(b) Fix the recovery rate at μ = 0.1. At the epidemic threshold, the infection rate has a specific value βc. Find βc.
(c) For 10 values of β from 0.5βc to 1.5βc simulate the SIS model stochastically:
i. Initialize the system with Ns = 0.1N seed nodes infected and the rest susceptible.
ii. For each time-step, sweep through the network. For infected nodes, switch them to susceptible with probability μ. For susceptible nodes, check their neighbors. For each neighbor that is infected, switch the susceptible node to infected with probability β. (Note that susceptible node i gets up to ki chances to become infected). Record the network state after each time- step/sweep. End the simulation if there are no more infected nodes (absorbing state) or t reaches tmax which should be no less than 500 in your simulation. t = tmax means the pandemic state has been reached. Execute no less than M = 50 trials for each value of β,re-initializing at random each time.
iii. For each value of β, plot the number of infected nodes at each time step. You should have M curves per plot.
iv. Plot the lifetimes of the epidemics as a function of β. For every value of β you will have atleast 50 lifetimes (according to the number of trials you ran). Plot the average lifetime as a function of beta. Add a vertical line at β = βc. What happens at βc? How is this result different than what you obtained with the continuous models described in the book
